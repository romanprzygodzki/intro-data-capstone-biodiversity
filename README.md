This is the Capstone Project submittal for Codecademy's Introduction To Data Analysis course.

The purpose of this project is to practice the key data analysis concepts covered in the class, including Pandas, Matplotlib and SciPy. Per Codecademy, the data relied upon for this project is fictional, so the outputs from the analysis are also fictional.
